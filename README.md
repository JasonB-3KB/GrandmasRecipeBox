## General info
As a Blue Badge final project, our team WYSIWYG decided upon creating a Recipe application that would essentially
replace all your recipes around your house, whether they were on papers or 3x5 cards, and make a one stop shop for 
all your favorite recipes in one easy to find location.


## Technologies
* Visual Studio Community 2019 - version 16.9.0 


## Code Examples
public bool CreateRecipe(RecipeCreate model)
        {
            var entity =
                new Recipe()
                {
                    OwnerId = _userId,
                    RecipeName = model.RecipeName,
                    Ingredients = model.Ingredients,
                    Instructions = model.Instructions,
                    SourceId = model.SourceId,
                    TypeOfCuisine = model.TypeOfCuisine,
                    TypeOfDish = model.TypeOfDish
                };
            using (var ctx = new ApplicationDbContext())
            {
                ctx.Recipes.Add(entity);
                return ctx.SaveChanges() == 1;
            }
        }

## Features
* Add a brand new recipe in just a few steps!
* Need to change the recipe a little? No problem, quickly and easily make changes to your recipe.
* Did the recipe not feed enough? Or did it seem too tomato-ey? Add a comment to your recipe for future reference!

To-do list:
* Add external source recipes
* Search by type of food

## Status
Project is: _in progress_, there is still a lot of room for growth within this application.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the desire to cook a variety of foods, but with the simplicity of using a one stop solution in the form of an app.

## Instructions
* Using Postman- register for your token
* Start running the app- copy and paste your link for Posting a source from your localhost API page
* Once you have posted a source with a 200 status, then you are ready to add a recipe using that source ID
* After the recipe is posted, you can now use the Recipe Id to post a comment on your recipe.
* If you now choose the Get recipe endpoint, you will see all of your information for that recipe, including a comment!
